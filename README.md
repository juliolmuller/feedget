Application developed during eighth edition of [Next Level Week](https://nextlevelweek.com/), delivered by [RocketSeat](https://rocketseat.com.br/). The objective here was to build a full JS stack widget to collect bug reports and feedbacks, so it can be embedded in any web or mobile application. Although the _React Native_ version was skipped, I was able to build (and have fun) the version for browsers and the backend for it. Amazing technologies learned!

[Check out the application running!](https://jlm-feedget.vercel.app/)

## :trophy: Lessons Learned

- Building a **React** application using **Tailwind CSS**;
- Taking screenshots directly from the browser;
- Creating accessible and keyboard-controllable interfaces (little hel from **Headless UI**);
- Adding and setting **Prisma** as ORM tool in a **Node** environment;
- Dealing with emails in development environment (with **MailTrap**);
- Organizing backend project following **SOLID** principles;
- Setting **unit testing** on the server-side;
- Deploying the applications at **Vercel** and **Railway**

## :rocket: Technologies & Resources

**Frontend:**
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as package manager and development runtime
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/)
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/)
- [HTML-to-Canvas converter](https://yorickshan.github.io/html2canvas-pro/)

**Backend:**
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as package manager, test runner and development runtime (using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for production)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
- [MailTrap service](https://mailtrap.io/)
- SOLID principles
- SQLIte database

**Development:**
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

## :hammer: Setting up the Environment

To set up the projects in your environment, make sure to have **Node.js 22+** and **Bun 1.2+** installed in your machine and the `bun` shortcuts available through the command line.

Besides, you will need to create a `.env` file in both folders `/server` and `/web`. These file hold some configuration and secrets to make the application runnable. You can use the `.env.example` file as template to know which variables should be configured.

With all these set, run the following commands to install dependencies and configure your database:

```bash
# Backend project
$ cd server/
$ bun install       # install project dependencies
$ bun run prepare   # update Prisma's interfaces with DB schema
$ bun run migrate   # ensure your DB schemas is up-to-date
$ bun run dev       # start the server in development mode

# Frontend project
$ cd web/
$ bun install       # install project dependencies
$ bun run dev       # start the server in development mode
```

## :zap: Features Implementations

The main idea of the project was developed during the NLW (Next Level Week) event and the result is the one available in [release v1](https://github.com/juliolmuller/feedget/releases/tag/v1.0.0). Afterwards, any incoming commits are intended to be incremental updates to improve the application, as proposed at the end of the event.

Besides, base project layout & design is available at **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/AsyJFfGRy4RbYPfBVYvE5q/Feedback-Widget)**.
